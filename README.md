# This is a basic Tic Tac Toe Game

There are two players:

- player_X
- player_O

In turns, starting with player_X, each player will choose a place in the board by entering the row and column they want, separated by a comma.

    +---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |
    +---+---+---+
    |   |   |   |

The program will show the state of the board after each turn and check.

The game will finish when a player has filled 3 spaces in line, either vertical, horizontal or diagonal.

If the board is filled with no winner, it will be a tie and the players will be asked if the want to play a new game.
